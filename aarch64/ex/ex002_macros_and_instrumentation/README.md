## macros and instrumentation

In [ex002a](ex002a_debug_log_demo), we demonstrate the basic debug logging process.

In [ex002b](ex002b_cat), we implement a basic `cat` executable with reduced functionality.

In [ex002c](ex002c_extract_bin), we eschew the clumsy and unportable `xxd` process for stripping the useful parts out of our boomer GNU-assembled object file by creating one ourselves.

In [ex002d](ex002d_extract_bin_macroless), we redo the previous without the bloated macros, to save space.

In [ex002e](ex002e_extract_bin_functionless), we redo the previous without trivial function calls.
