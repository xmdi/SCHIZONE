## the basics

In [ex002a](ex002a_debug_log_demo), we demonstrate the basic debug logging process.

In [ex002b](ex002b_cat), we implement a basic `cat` executable with reduced functionality.

In [ex002c](ex002c_binary_extractor), we eschew the clumsy and unportable `xxd` process for stripping the useful parts out of our boomer GNU-assembled object file.
